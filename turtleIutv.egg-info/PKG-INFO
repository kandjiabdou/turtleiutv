        This is a Turtle module for the Jupyter Notebook. It's based on code by
        `aspidites <https://github.com/macewanCMPT395/aspidites>`_, one of two groups at
        `Macewan University <http://macewan.ca/wcm/index.htm>`_ that built Turtle
        as a class assignment (the other was `PACattack <http://macewancmpt395.github.io/PACattack/>`_;
        I could have based this on either, but I had to pick one).
        
        Install it in a terminal/command prompt with::
        
            pip install git+https://gitlab.sorbonne-paris-nord.fr/11928898/turtleiutv.git
        
        
        Using it looks like this::
        
            from turtleIutv import *
            drawing()
            speed(5)
            colours=["red","blue","yellow","brown","black","purple","green"]
            up() 
            left(90)
            forward(200)
            right(90)
            down()
            i = 0
            while i < 18:
                setColor(colours[i%7])
                right(20)
                forward(50)
                i += 1
            goto(200, 200)
